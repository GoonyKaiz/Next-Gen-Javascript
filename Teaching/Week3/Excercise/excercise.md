# 🧩 Week 3 Exercises – Array Methods & Rest/Spread Operator

Follow these exercises to practice **array methods** and **rest/spread operators** in JavaScript. Try to solve them on your own, step by step.

---

## 📁 `rest-spread-operator/rest.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Write a function using the **rest operator** to collect all arguments passed in and console log them.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Write a function to get the **first and second arguments** separately, and use the rest operator to collect the remaining arguments. Console log all of them.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use the rest operator to get the **first 3 elements** of an array, and collect the rest. Console log them.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Use the rest operator to get `name`, `age`, `married`, `music`, and collect the rest of the properties from an object. Console log them.

## 📁 `rest-spread-operator/spread.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Use the **spread operator** to copy an array and an object. Console log the copies.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use the **spread operator** to merge two arrays and two objects. Console log the merged results.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use the spread operator to **add an element** to the **start** and **end** of an array.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Use the spread operator to **add a key-value pair** to the **start** and **end** of an object.

### 🔹 `ex5`

Merge two arrays using the spread operator, and also **add an element at the start and one at the end**. Console log the final array.

### 🔹 `ex6`

Merge two objects using the spread operator, and also **add a key-value pair at the start and one at the end**. Console log the final object.

## 📁 `array-methods/push-pop-shift-unshift.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Add a new fruit to the **end of the array** using `push`.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Remove the **last element** of the array using `pop`.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Add a new city to the **start of the array** using `unshift`.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Remove the **first element** of the array using `shift`.

### 🔹 `ex5`

Combine multiple operations (`push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`) and **console log the array** after each operation.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/slice.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Get the **first 3 elements** of an array using `slice`.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Get the **last 2 elements** of an array.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Get a **middle portion** of an array, excluding `"red"` and `"purple"`.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Get the **third element to the third last element** of an array.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/foreach.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Use `forEach` to console log the **area of a circle** for each radius in an array.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use `forEach` to print a **welcome message** for each person in an array.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use `forEach` to display the **price of each item after tax**.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/filter.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Create a new array containing only the even numbers from a given array.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Filter a list of people to get only those who are **30 or older**.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Filter products to get only those whose **price after tax is greater than 200**.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Filter teams that have **won a champion league**.

### 🔹 `ex5`

Filter girl groups to get only those with **less than 6 members**.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/map.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Create a new array containing the **square of each number** in a given array.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use `map` and the spread operator to **add a new key `"hobby"`** with the value `"Coding"` to each object in an array.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use `map` to create a new array of **full names** from an array of objects with `firstName` and `lastName`.
