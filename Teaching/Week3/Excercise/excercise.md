# 🧩 Week 3 Exercises – Array Methods & Rest/Spread Operator

Follow these exercises to practice **array methods** and **rest/spread operators** in JavaScript. Try to solve them on your own, step by step.

---

## 📁 `rest-spread-operator/rest.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Make a function using the **rest operator** to get all the arguments passed in and console log them.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Make a function to get the **first and second arguments** separately, and use the rest operator to get the remaining arguments. Console log all of them.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use the rest operator to get the **first 3 elements** of an array, and collect the rest. Console log them.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Use the rest operator to get `name`, `age`, `married`, `music`, and collect the rest of the properties from an object. Console log them.

## 📁 `rest-spread-operator/spread.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Use the **spread operator** to copy an array and an object of a given array and object. Console log the copies.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use the **spread operator** to merge two arrays and two objects. Console log the merged results.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use the spread operator to **add an element** to the **start** and **end** of an array.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Use the spread operator to **add a key** to the **start** and **end** of an object.

### 🔹 `ex5`

Use the spread operator to merge two arrays and also **add an element to the start and one at the end**.

### 🔹 `ex6`

Use the spread operator to merge two objects and also **add a key to the start and one at the end**.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/push-pop-shift-unshift.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Add a new fruit to the **end of the array** using `push`.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Remove the **last element** of the array using `pop`.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Add a new city to the **start of the array** using `unshift`.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Remove the **first element** of the array using `shift`.

### 🔹 `ex5`

Combine multiple operations (`push`, `unshift`, `pop`, `shift`) and **console log the results** after each operation.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/slice.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Get the **first 3 elements** of an array.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Get the **last 2 elements** of an array.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Get a **middle portion** of an array (excluding `"red"` and `"purple"`).

### 🔹 `ex4`

Get the **third element to the third last element** of an array.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/includes-indexOf-find.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Use `includes` to check if `"Charlie"` exists in an array.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use `includes` to check if `"Ivy"` exists in an array.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use `indexOf` to find the index of `"Eve"`.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Use `indexOf` to find the index of `"Zoe"` (should return `-1` if not found).

### 🔹 `ex5`

Use `find` to get the **first player whose name starts with `"D"`**.

### 🔹 `ex6`

Use `find` to get the **first player whose name length is 5**.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/foreach.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Use `forEach` to console log the **area of a circle** for each radius in an array.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use `forEach` to console log a **welcome message** for each person in an array.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use `forEach` to display the **price of an item after tax**.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/filter.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Use `filter` to create a new array with only the **even numbers**.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use `filter` to create a new array with only the **people who are 30 or older**.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use `filter` to create a new array with **products that have a price greater than 200 after tax**.

### 🔹 `ex4`

Use `filter` to create a new array with **books that have won an award**.

### 🔹 `ex5`

Use `filter` to create a new array with **sports teams that have less than 6 players**.

---

## 📁 `array-methods/map.js`

### 🔹 `ex1`

Use `map` to create a new array that contains the **square of each number** in the original array.

### 🔹 `ex2`

Use `map` and the **spread operator** to create a new array of objects with a new key `"hobby"` set to `"Coding"`.

### 🔹 `ex3`

Use `map` to create a new array that returns the **full name** of each object (combine `firstName` and `lastName`).
